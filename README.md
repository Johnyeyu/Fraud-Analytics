# Fraud-Analytics

In this training we are going to study about fraud analytics using a Decision Tree Classification Model.
Fraud detection is useful in finance and banking sectors, insurance as well in government agencies.
We are going to focus on the banking sector.
We have used the German credit card fraud dataset.

To predict cases of bank fraud, the data we use contains 20 variables which define characteristics of the individual applying for credit.


Class- Dependant Variable
Over Draft	
Credit Usage (duration in months)	
Credit History	
Purpose	
Current Balance	
Average Credit Balance
Employment	
Location	
Personal Status	
Other Parties	




Residence Since
Properties Magnitude
CC Age	
Other Payments	
Housing	
Existing Credits	
Job	
Number Dependents	
Own Telephone	
Foreign Worker	

In the end, we use confusion matrix and accuracy to evaluate the model performance.
